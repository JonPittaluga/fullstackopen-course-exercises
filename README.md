# README

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises of the Full Stack Open 2022 course.

The course is available at https://fullstackopen.com/en/

The course is divided into 9 parts, each part has its own folder.

### Organization and naming convention

The exercises will be located in the `exercises` folder, where subfolders will be created for each part. There will be a separated files named with the exercise name.

For example, the first exercise of the first part will be located in `exercises/part0` where there's a file called `0.4 New note.md` with the answer (a mermaid snippet to the markdown file to show the diagram) and I've also exported an image to show that diagram `0.4 New Note diagram.png`.
